            <h3>Craig Bohlman</h3>
            <p>Craig Bohlman brings an elite competitive background and a passion for cutting-edge training methods to every swimmer he coaches. One of his proudest early achievements came at just 12 years old, when he beat future Olympian Thomas Heilman in a 50-yard freestyle race — a moment that helped shape his competitive mindset for years to come.

                Craig went on to have an outstanding collegiate career at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was a standout sprinter and a critical part of the team’s success. During his time at UNC, Craig never lost a 2-2-2 set, demonstrating both his consistency and competitive edge in race-paced training environments. He later made a splash on the national stage by placing 2nd at the U.S. Olympic Trials in the 50 Free. In a testament to his character and sportsmanship, Craig famously chose to give up his Olympic spot, allowing the 3rd place swimmer to compete instead — a decision that earned him deep respect throughout the swimming community.
                
                Craig is deeply passionate about USRPT (Ultra Short Race Pace Training), believing in its power to maximize speed, efficiency, and recovery. He has studied extensively under Olympic medalist and renowned coach Brett Hawke, whose training philosophy heavily influences Craig’s coaching approach today.
                
                Dedicated to helping athletes reach their full potential, Craig blends science-backed methods with a personal, motivational coaching style. Whether working with beginners or elite-level sprinters, Craig's goal is always the same: to build confident, technically sound swimmers who love the sport and race with passion.</p>

            <h3>Carter Freudenstein</h3>
            <p>Carter Freudenstein brings a unique blend of precision, perseverance, and championship mindset to the pool. Before making waves in swimming, Carter was a prestigious golfer, dominating the high school and NAIA circuits with a focus on flawless technique. He famously recorded four hole-in-ones in a single match, setting a record that still stands and showcasing his attention to detail and mental toughness.

                It was during his golf recovery sessions that Carter first discovered the pool — and everything changed. Training under legendary coach Ron Aitken, Carter quickly realized that with hard work and discipline, anything was possible. Long hours of swimming led him to fall deeply in love with the sport, eventually trading in golf clubs for goggles full time.
                
                Carter’s breakout moment came in 2012 when he captured gold in the 200 freestyle, cementing his name in the swimming world. His victorious quote after the race, "You Lose, I Am Win," became a rallying cry for athletes striving to push past limits and seize their moment.
                
                Since then, Carter has coached numerous swimmers to success at all levels. In a memorable highlight of his career, he even defeated the legendary Michael Phelps during Phelps’ off-year, humbly reminding everyone, "Always stay ready," a lesson rooted in his golf background.
                
                Carter combines technical excellence with a fiery passion for competition, teaching swimmers to trust their preparation and embrace the pursuit of excellence every day. His coaching philosophy is simple: work smart, work hard, and race with heart.</p>
