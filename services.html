    <h2>Our Services</h2>

    <h3>Private Swim Lessons</h3>
    <p>We offer individualized private lessons designed to meet swimmers exactly where they are. Whether it's learning the basics of freestyle, mastering backstroke turns, or fine-tuning elite-level butterfly technique, Craig and Carter customize each session to fit your unique needs. Private coaching ensures swimmers get 100% attention to accelerate progress and build confidence in the water.</p>

    <h3>Stroke Technique Refinement</h3>
    <p>Perfecting technique is critical for long-term success. We provide detailed stroke analysis, drills, and progression plans to help swimmers move more efficiently through the water. From body position to hand entry, we break down each element to help athletes maximize speed while minimizing resistance and injury risk. Our technique sessions are beneficial for all ages — from beginners to seasoned competitors seeking marginal gains.</p>

    <h3>Race Strategy and Tactics</h3>
    <p>Winning races requires more than just raw speed. We teach swimmers how to strategically plan races, from pacing the first 50 meters to executing perfect breakouts and turns. Our coaching emphasizes race visualization, breathing patterns, energy conservation, and sprint finish techniques tailored to each swimmer’s strengths. Specialized sessions for event-specific strategy (e.g., 100m vs. 500m freestyle) are also available.</p>

    <h3>Strength and Conditioning for Swimmers</h3>
    <p>In collaboration with certified strength coaches, we offer dryland training programs specifically designed for swimmers. These workouts focus on core stability, shoulder strength, explosiveness off the blocks, and injury prevention. Whether you're in-season or in off-season training, we’ll build a customized plan that complements your water work and helps you achieve peak performance safely and effectively.</p>

    <h3>Competition Preparation Programs</h3>
    <p>Getting ready for a big meet? Our Competition Preparation Programs include a full cycle of tapering strategies, mental preparation, nutrition tips, and recovery planning. We work closely with athletes to peak at the right time, ensuring they step onto the block confident and race-ready. Programs can be tailored for high school state championships, club meets, college recruiting races, or national-level competitions.</p>

    <h3>Video Analysis and Feedback</h3>
    <p>We use underwater and above-water video footage to capture a swimmer’s performance in real time. Our detailed feedback sessions identify strengths and pinpoint areas for improvement, allowing swimmers to visualize corrections and understand the \"why\" behind technical adjustments. This service is especially valuable for advanced athletes seeking to refine minute details that can make a huge difference in race outcomes.</p>

    <h3>Group Clinics and Camps</h3>
    <p>Throughout the year, Craig and Carter host swim clinics and mini-camps focused on various skills such as starts, turns, IM transitions, and race day mindset. These group sessions offer the opportunity for swimmers to learn in a dynamic team environment while getting hands-on corrections and motivation from expert coaches.</p>
